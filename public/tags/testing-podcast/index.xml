      <description>Testing and Frustrations
Listening to this episode in Testing One on One podcast made me thing about the strong feelings (I will not use the word frustration) I have about testing. For example, why most of the people that want to start a career in IT think they should begin with testing, &amp;ldquo;because it&amp;rsquo;s easier&amp;rdquo;. Or why testing/testers are not getting the same importance as developing/developers. After all, we all are in the same boat and should have the same goal: happy customers.</description>
