      <title>Agile Testing: A Practical Guide for Testers and Agile Teams</title>

      <description>I received the book a couple of years ago from my Scrum Master (thanks Johan!). He was strongly recommending it for the entire team. So, another book suited not only for testers but for the entire team, especially in an agile environment.
Nowadays, when everyone talks about Modern Testing and TestOps, this book might seem outdated but reading it can help familiarize with terms, practices and roles in agile. Before learning how to run, you have to know how to walk.</description>

      <title>To all the Good Evil Testers out there: Dear Evil Tester</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Dear Evil Tester&amp;rdquo; is a book from Yonder testing bookshelf. This is how I got the chance to read it. It is written in Alan Richardson&amp;rsquo;s unique style.
I don&amp;rsquo;t think you will find another testing book that will make you laugh out loud as this one (unless it&amp;rsquo;s so bad that it&amp;rsquo;s funny).
No alt text provided for this image It includes 3 parts. The first one contains answers to the letters received by the author at &amp;ldquo;The Testing Planet&amp;rdquo;.</description>
