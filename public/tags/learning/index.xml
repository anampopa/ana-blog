      <description>Test Sphere is a card deck about (obviously) testing from Ministry of Testing. The cards are treating different aspects, being divided in 5 categories:
 Heuristics, Techniques, Feelings, Quality aspects, Patterns.  Each card presents a testing concept and 3 directions to tackle the concept.
It is usually used to create a testing approach, for risk storming or in scrum events such as planning (to look at the next increment in a different way) or retrospectives (especially the cards in Feelings category).</description>
