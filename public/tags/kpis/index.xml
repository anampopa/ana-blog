      <description>There is a question that keeps bugging me for a while: How to measure testing, what metrics should I take into consideration?
Starting with the failed experience of reporting some indicators that were looking good for the management, but didn’t really help me or the end customers, I asked myself: is there any point in measuring some indicators for quality? Why should I even bother to look at some numbers if they don’t matter that much?</description>
