Here's a list of books that I find useful for testers:

- Lessons Learned in Software Testing
- Explore It!
- Agile Testing
- Dear Evil Tester

Reading them helps a lot in creating the mindset, improving your vocabulary so you can better express your view when needed and you can learn from other people's experience
