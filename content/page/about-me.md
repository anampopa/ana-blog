My name is Ana Maria Popa. I am a tester since 2013 and a certified Scrum Master since 2018.  
I love testing and I love learning. This blog is my attempt to combine these two with a third one,
which I also do with enthusiasm: knowledge sharing. I will also use this blog for taking notes
for myself and future me or pin some interesting ideas that I run into.

I am a big fan of testing communities, regardless the format: meet ups, conferences, local events,
clusters, groups. Being a continuous learner, I find inspiration in the great names of the industry and
give it further to the other fellow tester by coaching them.
