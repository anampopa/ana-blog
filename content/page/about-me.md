My name is Ana Maria Popa. I am a tester since 2013 and a certified Scrum Master since 2018.  
I love testing and I love learning. This blog is my attempt to combine these two with a third one,
which I also do with enthusiasm: knowledge sharing. But I will also use it to practice writing and
for taking notes for myself and future me or pin some interesting ideas that I run into.

I am a big fan of testing communities, regardless the format: meet ups, conferences, local events,
clusters, groups. I try to bring my input in the communities I am a part of as often as I can. 
I look for inspiration in the great names of the industry and give it further to the other fellow tester by coaching them.
