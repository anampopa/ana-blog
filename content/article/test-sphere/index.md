Test Sphere is a card deck about (obviously) testing from [Ministry of Testing](https://store.ministryoftesting.com/collections/testsphere).
The cards are treating different aspects, being divided in 5 categories:

* Heuristics,
* Techniques,
* Feelings,
* Quality aspects,
* Patterns.

Each card presents a testing concept and 3 directions to tackle the concept.
  
It is usually used to create a testing approach, for risk storming or in scrum events such as planning
(to look at the next increment in a different way) or retrospectives (especially the cards in Feelings category).

These are the original rules of the game: http://www.testknight.de/playing-the-testsphere-game/

Some time ago, I thought about putting the Test Sphere at a different use: bonding the team, sharing ideas, involving every tester in the company in
a competitive, yet resourceful activity. We previously had similar activities on testing topics and we called those "challenges".
So I called this one "Autumn Testing Challenge", because it took place during the 3 months of Autumn.

Soon all my colleagues in the testing community joined the activity. We worked in teams made of 3 members and we balanced the teams 
in order to have testers with more experience working together with testers that wanted to learn more.

Each week, cards from 3 random categories were picked up and sent to the teams.
Each team had to debate and offer their perspective on the topic. The solution was presented to the rest
of the participants and then voted.

At the end the teams were awarded for:

* Popularity: number of votes from people outside the team, 
* Fair play: number of votes for other teams, 
* Winner for the total number of votes.

The most exciting part from this challenge (apart from the prize) was the teams getting together, brainstorming
and sharing ideas so, in my opinion, the purpose of this card game was achieved, and results were visible in
people's enthusiasm and involvement.
