A list of books is just a list unless you've read the books, you processed the information and you have an opinion about it. So I'm going to write a few thoughts about the books that I mentioned in my previous post.

I will start with "Lessons Learned in Software Testing: A Context Driven Approach" by Cem Kaner, James Bach and Bret Pettichord. It is a compilation of testing related stories, experience gathered by the authors along many years, summarized in 293 lessons.

If you are in testing field and you haven't heard about Cem Kaner, James Bach or Bret Pettichord, do a quick research because they are the ones setting the trends in testing (especially James Bach).

I have to admit, I got interested in this book right from the beginning, with the comparison between drinking a glass of port wine and reading the book. What goes better with reading a book than drinking a glass of good wine.

As stated by the authors, this it is not a book only about testing, it is a book about software development and anyone that has something to do with software quality can learn something from it. It is context driven because it talks about practices that are suited in a certain circumstance and not about „best practices” that should be applied in any situation and fix any issue.

With Bach's typical focus on the bugs, the author treats this subject with high importance. From tips on where to find tricky bugs to the importance of a captivating bug report, the author dedicates a great amount of pages for the topic.

Chapter 3: Testing techniques is particularly interesting because it gives a great insight about the many ways that you can tackle testing. And it is not a bunch of definition in ISTQB-like, but some practical examples of why and when you should use that specific technique.

Some other memorable lessons in the book:

- Automation: when it should be done and when it shouldn’t. Which are the pitfalls but also advice on how to design your automated tests;
- Soft skills and the importance of a healthy relation with developers and stakeholders;
- How to mentor a testing team and set the right expectations with your team;
- How to hire best people and tricks for a successful interview;
- Which are the testing paths that you can choose from and how to manage your testing career.

Even if it was published in 2001, this book gives you so much insight about testing and software quality. If you have a few years of experience, it is impossible not to find yourself in at least one of the stories. Read the lessons in the given order or read the ones that will get your interest. In any case you will have something to learn.
