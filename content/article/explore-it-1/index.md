"Explore It! Reduce the Risk and Increase Confidence with Exploratory Testing" is the second book in my list. Part of Pragmatic Bookshelf, reading it made me change my testing mindset, improve my skills and helped me discover new and useful heuristics. Elisabeth Hendrickson's book is full of stories and practical example and should be kept on any tester's desk in order to be consulted at need.

This is not a book that you can read while laying in the bed. Each chapter ends with a section titled "Practice Sessions" that will help you put in practice the concepts in the chapter right away.

Exploratory testing is not just clicking around, hoping that you will run into a bug, as many people might think. If we are looking for a definition, the one of James Bach might be a proper one. In 2003 paper, "Exploratory Testing Explained", he mentioned that "Exploratory testing is simultaneous learning, test design and test execution". So it's a process that involves a lot of thinking and decision making.

The truth is that anyone can do exploratory testing but in order to do it efficiently, you have to have a well established purpose, otherwise you will just wandering around, losing precious time.

As the author of the book suggests, a system should be explored in sessions for which you set the focus in advance. These sessions are time-boxed and you should take notes so you know what you explored and what information you found. For a good exploratory session, a charter should be created containing:

- Target: Where are you exploring? It could be a feature, a requirement, or a module.
- Resources: What resources will you use? It could be anything from a tool, a data set, a technique, a configuration, or an independent feature.
- Information: What kind of information are you hoping to find? Is your focus the security, performance, reliability of the system.

A good charter should be short and concise and should not be anything like a test case.

The book contains a lot of interesting heuristics, how to use variables and their variations, how to recognize entities, attributes and dependencies between them, how to play with data and find the fine weakness in your system.

It is in this book that I first encountered the personas technique, the "never and always" or the "nightmare headline game" that I always apply now when I'm evaluating a system.

Exploratory testing doesn't apply only when there is an interface. You can explore an API, a programming language, a web service, the requirements or why not, you can asses the exploratory skills of a candidate using an exploratory session. For more information, you should definitely read the book.
