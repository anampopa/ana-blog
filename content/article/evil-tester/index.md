"Dear Evil Tester" is a book from Yonder testing bookshelf. This is how I got the chance to read it. It is written in Alan Richardson's unique style.

I don't think you will find another testing book that will make you laugh out loud as this one (unless it's so bad that it's funny).

It includes 3 parts. The first one contains answers to the letters received by the author at "The Testing Planet". The second contains pieces of advice. The advice you can perhaps find also in other books but the parallels with psychology, philosophy or even children books makes this part really out of the box. The third part contains essays which summaries the attitudes and approaches evidenced in the letter answers.

The book is scattered with slogans, sketches created by the author and even poems so Alan Richardson is using his creativity at his best.

The slogans the author writes are really memorable. They became inspirational mottos for me. Here are a few of them:

- "Not all testers are evil, just the good ones"
- "I’m not Evil, I’m necessary"
- "May all your good testing dreams come true"
- "Yup, that's what testers try to do. We cheat, get over it."
- "If Pinocchio were an experienced test manager and he wrote in a test strategy “Testing will demonstrate that the system is fit for purpose to go live”. Would his nose grow?"
- "If someone gives you something and asks you to test it again and again and again. How do your eyes not fire up? How does your trident not tingle with delight? How can you not be ager to test? How is that possible?"
  The brand that Alan Richardson created around Evil Tester is standing out in a good way. It is indeed as he mentions in his first answer "deliberately engaging in false advertising for shock effect". Behind the black humor and the fine irony you can find good advice based on data, facts and experience.

I also strongly recommend "Java for testers" by the same author. It is a technical book and this is why I didn't include it in my initial list that contained books which help improving the testing mindset. You can read Alan Richardson's [__blog__](https://www.eviltester.com/blog/), he also has many courses or you can listen to his podcast: [__The Evil Tester Show__](https://www.eviltester.com/show/).
