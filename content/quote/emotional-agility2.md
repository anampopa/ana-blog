Here are some other characteristics of values:
- They are freely chosen and have not been iposed on you.
- They are not goals. They are ongoing rather than fixed.
- They guide you rather than constraint you.
- They are active, not static.
- They allow you to get closer to the waay you want to live your live.
- They bring you freedom from social comparisons.
- They foster self- acceptance, which is crucial to mental health.
  Above all, a value is something that you can use. It helps you place your feet in the right direction
  as you journey through life, no matter where life leads you.

Here are a few questions to ask yourself in order to start identifying your values:
- Deep down, what matters to me?
- What relationships do I want to buid?
- What do I want my lif to be about? What kind of situations make me feel most fit?
- If a miracle occured and all the anxiety and stress in my life were gone, what would my life look like and what new things would I pursue?
