Here are some other characteristics of values:

They are freely chosen and have not been imposed on you.
They are not goals. That is, they are ongoing rather than fixed.
They guide you rather than constraint you.
They are active, not static.
They allow you to get closer to the way you want to live your live.
They bring you freedom from social comparisons.
They foster self-acceptance, which is crucial to mental health.
 
Above all, a value is something that you can use. It helps you place your feet in the right direction
as you journey through life, no matter where life leads you.
