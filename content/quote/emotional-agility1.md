Here are a few questions to ask yourself in order to start identifying your values:

Deep down, what matters to me?
What relationships do I want to build?
What do I want my life to be about? What kind of situations make me feel most fit?
If a miracle occurred and all the anxiety and stress in my life were gone, what would my life look like and what new things would I pursue?
