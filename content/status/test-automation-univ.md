don't know the way. People from [__Test Automation University__](https://testautomationu.applitools.com/) suggest the [__learning path__](https://testautomationu.applitools.com/learningpaths.html) for multiple
topics.
You can also find the related courses, provided by important names in testing field. Of course, a
few hours course won't make you a master and you will have to dig a little deeper.
