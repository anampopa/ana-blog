Testing and Frustrations

Listening to this episode in Testing One on One [__podcast__](https://qablog.practitest.com/frustrations-in-testing-what-to-do-about-them/) made me thing about the strong feelings (I will not use the
word frustration) I have about testing. For example, why most of the people that want to start a career in IT think
they should begin with testing, "because it's easier". Or why testing/testers are not getting the same importance as
developing/developers. After all, we all are in the same boat and should have the same goal: happy customers.
