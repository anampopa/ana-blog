Here's a list of books that I find useful for testers:

- [__Lessons Learned in Software Testing__](https://www.amazon.com/Lessons-Learned-Software-Testing-Context-Driven/dp/0471081124)
- [__Explore It!__](https://www.amazon.com/Explore-Increase-Confidence-Exploratory-Testing/dp/1937785025/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=explore+it&qid=1614179125&s=books&sr=1-1)
- [__Agile Testing__](https://www.amazon.com/Agile-Testing-Practical-Guide-Testers/dp/0321534468/ref=sr_1_1?crid=9AVS1E37MCVM&dchild=1&keywords=agile+testing+a+practical+guide+for+testers+and+agile+teams&qid=1614179167&s=books&sprefix=agile+test%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C265&sr=1-1)
- [__Dear Evil Tester__](https://www.amazon.com/Dear-Evil-Tester-Provocative-Richardson/dp/B01F7XE0AA/ref=sr_1_2?crid=2ACBDSGUPRDQF&dchild=1&keywords=dear+evil+tester&qid=1614179206&sprefix=dear+evil+%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C266&sr=8-2)


Reading them helps a lot in creating the mindset, improving your vocabulary so you can better express your view when needed and you can learn from other people's experience
