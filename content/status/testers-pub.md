Tester's Pub at Yonder

Testers' Pub it's an event that I am very fond of. I was there when the idea popped up
and I was more or less involved in every edition 

With this edition we are moving the pub in online, as most of the similar events do. 
Hopefully this is not for good, and we will still be able to see each other into a real pub.

Even though the context changed, the purpose for Tester's pub is the same: bringing together people that are pasionate 
about testing, sharing knowledge , learning new stuff together: participants, speakers or organizers.
